# My recipes

Milestone Project - 2 - rpi recipes

I designed my project for those who love to cook and are searching for new recipes. The website utilises an API to return many different receipe 
options for whatever the user wants to search for. The user is presented with mutlitple options displaying images of the food, serving size and the 
time it will take to make! When a user clicks on their desired recipe, they are directed to the 'allrecipes' site for more information. 

My search API is on a single page format and very user friendly. 

This site has been built using a combination of the skills I have learnt so far in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Deployment and Demo 
The project is hosted on GitHub Pages

## The process involved:

- Host a git repository on GitHub.

- Create project in GitPod saving each big change for version control to GitHub.

- Open your project repository in GitHub.

- Click on settings.

- Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.

- Click on source and select master branch.

- After the page refreshes you will have a link to your deployed website.

- Final product now hosted on GitHub Pages.


## To deploy your own version of the website:
- Have git installed

- Visit the repository

- Click 'Clone or download' and copy the code for http

- Open your chosen IDE (Cloud9, VS Code, etc.)

The benefits of hosting your website on GitHub pages is that any pushed changes to your project will automatically update the website. Development branches can be created and merged to the master when complete.
It may take a moment for changes to appear on the hosted website.
During development the site is written in VS Code. It is run using Live Server plugin for VS Code.
